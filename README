What is it?
===========
A little web service that exposes the egg2ofx gem over http.


Installation
============
$ git clone <this-project-repository>.git egg2ofx-server
$ cd egg2ofx-server
$ gem install bundler # I use gem bundler to package up all the dependencies
$ gem bundle # Build out the required dependencies
$ ruby egg2ofx.rb # Or, installed Passenger and use the excellent Passenger preference pane to make this available at egg2ofx.local or summit.


Usage
=====
While you can manually construct a POST request (see below), it's probably best used in combination with the egg2ofx-greasemonkey script that allows you to download your egg statements, in the OFX format, directly from the egg website.

$ cat downloaded-statement.html | ruby -rcgi -e "puts 'documentHtml=' + CGI.escape(STDIN.read)" | curl http://egg2ofx.seagul.co.uk -d@-
